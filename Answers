1.Components of a DBMS

Database Engine: This is the core service for accessing and processing data. It handles data storage, retrieval, and updating.

Database Schema: This defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, data types, and relationships.

Query Processor: This component interprets and executes SQL queries, optimizing them for performance.

Transaction Management: This ensures that all database transactions are processed reliably and adheres to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Database Administration Tools: These tools help manage the database, providing functionalities for backup, recovery, and performance tuning.

User Interface: This allows users to interact with the database, often through graphical user interfaces or command-line tools.


2.Relational Database
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables, which are structured in rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and relationships between tables are established through foreign keys.
Examples of Relational Databases:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server

3.Classifications of SQL

Data Query Language (DQL): This includes commands that retrieve data from the database, primarily using the SELECT statement.

Data Definition Language (DDL): This includes commands that define the database structure, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): This includes commands that manipulate data within the database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.


4.Difference between Primary Key and Foreign Key

Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and cannot contain null values.

Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and can contain null values.

5.Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities within a database and their relationships. It uses symbols to represent entities, attributes, and the connections between entities, helping to plan and design the database structure.
Advantages of Relational Databases

6.Data Integrity: Enforces data accuracy and consistency through constraints like primary and foreign keys.

Flexibility: Allows for complex queries and data manipulation using SQL.

Scalability: Can handle large amounts of data and support multiple users efficiently.

Data Security: Provides mechanisms for user access control and data protection.


7.Types of Data Types Used to Store Data in Tables

Integer: Used to store whole numbers.
VARCHAR: Used to store variable-length strings.
DATE: Used to store date values.
BOOLEAN: Used to store true/false values.

8.Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)
The purpose of a DBMS is to provide a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data in databases. It facilitates data organization, ensures data integrity and security, supports multi-user access, and allows for efficient data management and retrieval through query languages like SQL.
